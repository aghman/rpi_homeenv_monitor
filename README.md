# Raspberry-Pi Projects
Thoughts and research on a raspberry pi-based home environment monitoring device (or many devices)

## Research
* [Radios](research/radio.md)
* [Environmental Monitoring](research/environment.md)
* [Plane Tracking](research/plane.md)

## Goals/Ideas

### Portable Car-Pi
* Connects to car computer, monitors its output. 
* Scans radio stations, looks for strong ones (good for road trips)
* Listens for smokey on police scanner
* Guesses how many cell phones are around (monitoring higher radio frequencies?)
### Seed Library/Environmental Monitoring Station
* Weather/Air Pollution monitor
* Tracks door opening
* What's gone in and out? 
* Counts people walking by
* Communicates with soil moisture measuring devices
* Collects noise data
### Airplane Tracker!
* Counts airplanes around
* just sounds cool
### Parking Strip Monitor
* Facing road, counts cars going by
* Noise and air pollution tracking
### Under-house Monitor
* Temperature, air quality monitor
* Motion detection (pests)
### Attic/Wifi Monitor
* Temperature, air quality monitor
* Motion detection (pests)
* Wifi station counting
